# scRNAseq-Analysis
This is a workflow carrying out scRNAseq analysis as well as differential gene expression, GO, KEGG and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to determine genetic signatures and pathways targeted by cells expressing a specfic gene.

The scRNAseq is carried out using the Seurat workflow to cluster cells, differentialy gene expression determines the genes signficantly upregulated and downregulated in clusters with a high expression of a specific gene, and the enrichment analysis determines the higher biological pathways and gene sets targeted by these differentially expressed genes.

The analysis can be broken down into the following steps:

(1) Quality Control and Filtering

(2) Normalization

(3) Clustering and Visualization

(4) Differential Gene expression

(5) GO and KEGG Enrichment

(6) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
